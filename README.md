# UX 1 Final 
## Part One - Pain Points 
Choose a unique app that no one else has selected yet from your section of UX 1, and sign up for it through [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ro0M7ucmMkKDUlOn_015SXwmw00CK6N2K1V_zLxJMO4/edit?usp=sharing).

Then, get ready to dive deep: you’ll design thoughtful solutions to its top usability issues. You’ll also build a compelling case study showing employers the research and strategy behind your improved design.

Here are some excellent examples of UX case studies like the one you’ll create:
* [Meetup](https://uxdesign.cc/meetup-a-usability-case-study-e909c33f1e3e)
* [Instagram](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/i-wanted-to-see-how-far-i-could-push-myself-creatively-so-i-redesigned-instagram-1ff99f28fa8b)
* [London By Bike](http://simonpan.com/work/bikes-case-study/)
* [Fitbit](https://uxdesign.cc/fitbit-a-usability-case-study-b23e4c539c3c)

If you’re having trouble finding a challenging user flow to tackle, look for popular apps with low ratings in the app store. What usability issues do user complaints describe? Users won’t touch an app that’s difficult to navigate, no matter how beautiful the design. What are the biggest pain points and blockers users run into? You’ll identify the top issues that users face (and that your design will aim to resolve).

Start by downloading the app and going through all possible actions, focusing on key tasks users would want/need to take. Look for areas of confusion, inefficiency, and other usability issues, referring to [Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics.](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/)

### Examples of what to look out for:
* Is the navigation clear?
* How easy is it to complete tasks?
* Is content organized effectively?
* Are frequently used buttons/links conveniently located?
* Are links/features clearly accessible?
* Is it easy to find information/support?

### Submission
Identify 5 usability issues with the app's existing design. Provide a brief write-up relating usability heuristics to the issues you have identified. Include screenshots with annotations for reference.
